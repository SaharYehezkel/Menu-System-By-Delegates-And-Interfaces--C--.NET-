# C# Delegates and Interfaces: Menu System

## Project Description
This C# project, titled "Menu System using Delegates and Interfaces," is composed of three main parts: `Ex04.Menus.Delegates`, `Ex04.Menus.Interfaces`, and `Ex04.Menus.Test`. It showcases the use of delegates, interfaces, and object-oriented programming principles in C#. The project demonstrates how to create a dynamic and extensible menu system using these concepts.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Delegates Usage**: In `Ex04.Menus.Delegates`, demonstrates the implementation of menu actions using delegates.
- **Interfaces Implementation**: `Ex04.Menus.Interfaces` showcases how to achieve similar functionality using interfaces.
- **Dynamic Menu Creation**: Both modules illustrate how to create dynamic menus that can be easily extended or modified.
- **Test and Application Flow**: `Ex04.Menus.Test` contains the executable part of the project, demonstrating the usage and integration of the menu system.
- **Object-Oriented Principles**: The project applies key OOP concepts like encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance in its structure.

## Prerequisites
- Microsoft Visual Studio.
- Basic to intermediate knowledge of C#.
- Understanding of delegates, interfaces, and object-oriented programming in C#.
